# PHP for Beginners Course Notes

## Episode 01 - How to Choose a Programming Language

- **Your first programming language matters less than learning core programming fundamentals because concepts such as variables, loops, and conditionals transfer to other languages.**
  ```php
  $orders = [
      ['id' => 101, 'status' => 'paid'],
      ['id' => 102, 'status' => 'pending'],
  ];

  foreach ($orders as $order) {
      if ($order['status'] === 'paid') {
          echo "Ship order #{$order['id']}" . PHP_EOL;
      }
  }
  ```

> **Takeaway:** Choose a language and start learning; once the fundamentals click, learning another language becomes much easier.

## Episode 02 - Tools of the Trade

- **Choose an editor you can work comfortably in; Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text are both suitable options.**
  ```text
  Visual Studio Code
  Sublime Text
  ```

- **A terminal only needs to support basic navigation, file listing, and running commands for this course.**
  ```bash
  cd ~/Desktop
  ls
  ```

- **On macOS or Linux, Homebrew provides a straightforward way to install PHP and MySQL.**
  ```bash
  brew install php
  brew install mysql
  ```

- **Use `php -v` to confirm PHP is installed; the recording used PHP 8.1.4, but package managers may install a newer version.**
  ```bash
  php -v
  # Recording example: PHP 8.1.4
  ```

- **On Windows, Laragon is a beginner-friendly all-in-one environment, while WSL2 is better suited to people already familiar with it.**
  ```text
  Windows recommendation: Laragon
  Alternative: WSL2
  ```

- **Docker, XAMPP, and MAMP are valid alternatives, but choose one local environment rather than combining several.**
  ```text
  Choose one: Laragon, WSL2, Docker, XAMPP, or MAMP
  ```

> **Takeaway:** Pick a comfortable editor and one local environment that lets you run PHP and MySQL; the specific tool matters less than getting started.
